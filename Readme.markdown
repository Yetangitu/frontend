Forked from Openphoto/Trovebox. As the commercial activities around this seem to have failed and are about to be shut down, and seeing that I use this code myself and thus would like to keep it alive, forking seemed to be no more than prudent. For now, nothing has changed, if/when this happens this will become apparent. It is not like this code is bug-free, far from it...
Some 'new' features I'd like to add are:

 * better/working media support
 * integration with Owncloud - maybe this could be implemeneted as an Owncloud app, replacing the rather restricted gallery app
 * some usable photo editing options
 * better tagging (something like f-spot tags, drag/drop
 * hierarchical tags?
 * desktop integration to enable faster photo management of large library? Maybe integrate with an existing photo management app like Digikam, Darktable or even (the ghost of) F-spot?
 * Better performance on large libraries
As said, for now nothing has changed. Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.
